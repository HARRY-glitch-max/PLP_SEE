# 🎉 Fun Calculator 🧮

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** – a lighthearted Python program that performs basic math operations with style! 😎

## ✨ Features

This calculator lets you:

* ➕ Add two numbers
* ➖ Subtract one number from another
* ✖️ Multiply two numbers
* ➗ Divide one number by another

All with cheerful comments and helpful prompts!

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

1. **Run the Python script** in your terminal or code editor:

   ```bash
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```

2. **Enter two numbers** when prompted:

   * You can use integers or decimals (e.g., `7`, `3.14`).

3. **View the results**:

   * The script will display the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the numbers you entered.

## 🚨 Note

* Make sure the second number is **not zero** to avoid a division error. This version assumes users won’t try dividing by zero (we believe in you! 😄).

## 📁 Example Output

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## 🧠 Why This is Cool

This project is a great starting point for:

* Learning how to use input and output in Python
* Performing basic arithmetic operations
* Adding fun, expressive comments to code 😄
